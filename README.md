Java-related projects from pure feature or technology testing to pattern implementations.

* **design-patterns**: Maven project to hold Java implementations of Object-Oriented software design patterns with their corresponding tests. 

  This project is based on "Gang of Four" Design Patterns [GOF1995] principles. Other online sources have been taken into account as [TP2014] or [JC2000].
  
  _NOTE: As it is intended to be a tutorial project, class implementations are being kept as simpler as possible for the specific pattern (well documented, though), and "business logic" implementation is often simplified as "sysout" calls. No more dependencies far from JUnit have been considered at first._

* **java8-new-features**: Maven project to hold Java test usage implementations of new features of Java 8 [ORAJSENEW2014].
