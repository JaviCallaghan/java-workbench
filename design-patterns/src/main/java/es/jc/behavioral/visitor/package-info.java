/**
 * Visitor behavioral-pattern implementation.<br>
 * [GOF] Visitor - Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you
 * define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.<br>
 * This implementation is simpler than defined by [GOF] as it not makes includes several element implementations nor
 * specific behaviors for any of them.
